# Spring Boot Debezium - Master Slave Real Project Example

### In this demo, we will explore how to implement Change Data Capture (CDC) in a master-slave architecture using Spring Boot and Debezium. 

To implement Change Data Capture (CDC) in a master-slave architecture using Spring Boot and Debezium, you can follow these steps:

Setting up the Database:
Set up your database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) with the required tables. Ensure that binary logging is enabled in your database settings.

Add Dependencies:
In your Spring Boot project's pom.xml, add dependencies for Spring Boot, Debezium, and the database connector (e.g., debezium-connector-mysql).

Configure Debezium:
Configure Debezium in your Spring Boot application. This involves setting up properties like database connection details, CDC configuration, etc. Configure Debezium to use the appropriate connector for your database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

Define Kafka Connect Configuration:
Define the Kafka Connect configuration file to specify the source database, topics, and other configurations. 

Implement the Consumer/ Listener:
Implement a Kafka consumer in your Spring Boot application to consume the change events published by Debezium. Process these change events and apply them to your slave database accordingly.

Replicate Changes to Slave Database:
Use the information from the consumed change events to apply the corresponding changes to the slave database. Implement mechanisms to handle data consistency, error handling, and conflict resolution if needed. 

Handle Data Transformations:
If required, transform the data before applying it to the slave database. This might involve mapping data types, restructuring data, etc.
